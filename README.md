    This is a small project that is used to offer a proper way to get Bangumi Information and Video rank from Bilibili.tv.It's very simple,just ues its owm API server(api.bilibili.com).Current Version has some problems with the Multiple thread management.The Asynctask did't work as good as I wished.I'm still trying to fix it up!But next week I gotto go to the school.I'm not sure if I can get sufficient time to work on the project so far.
